# This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions "workflow" specifically for running your
# frontend End-to-End (E2E) tests using Playwright. It automates the process of setting up
# an environment, installing dependencies, starting your application, and running the tests.

# Sets the display name for this entire workflow. This is the name you will see
# in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository, making it easy to identify.
name: Playwright E2E

# The 'on' key is the event trigger section. It specifies which GitHub events
# will cause this workflow to automatically start running.
on:

  # This configures the workflow to run on a `git push` event.
  push:

    # This is a crucial filter. It specifies that the `push` event will ONLY trigger
    # this workflow if the push is to the `main` branch. Pushes to other feature
    # branches (e.g., `my-new-feature`) will NOT run this workflow.
    branches: [main]

  # This configures the workflow to run when a pull request event occurs.
  pull_request:

    # This is another filter. It specifies that the `pull_request` event will ONLY
    # trigger this workflow if the pull request's TARGET branch is `main`.
    branches: [main]

# The 'jobs' key defines one or more jobs that the workflow will execute.
jobs:

  # This line defines a single job with the unique ID 'e2e'.
  # This ID is used to refer to the job in other parts of the workflow if needed.
  e2e:

    # 'runs-on' specifies the type of virtual machine this job will execute on.
    # `ubuntu-latest` provides a fresh, clean environment running the latest stable
    # version of Ubuntu Linux for every run, ensuring consistent test results.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # 'steps' defines a sequence of tasks that will be executed in order within this job.
    # If any step fails, the job will stop by default.
    steps:

      # The hyphen `-` denotes a list item, making this the first step.
      # `uses: actions/checkout@v3` tells this step to run a pre-built action from the GitHub Marketplace.
      # This specific action is essential: it checks out your repository's code and downloads it
      # onto the runner, so your workflow can access all your project files (e.g., package.json, test files).
      # The `@v3` pins the action to a specific major version for stability.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # This is the second step in the job. The `name` provides a human-readable label
      # that will be displayed in the GitHub Actions UI logs, making it easy to see what's happening.
      - name: Set up Node.js

        # This step uses another official action, `setup-node`, which installs and configures Node.js on the runner.
        # This is necessary because your T3 app and Playwright itself are Node.js-based tools.
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3

        # The 'with' block is used to provide input parameters to the action specified in `uses`.
        with:

          # This input tells the `setup-node` action to install Node.js version 22.16.0.
          # Specifying a version ensures your tests run in the same environment as the development machine.
          node-version: 22.16.0

      # This is the third and final step of the job. It's a single, multi-line script block
      # responsible for installing all dependencies and then executing the Playwright tests.
      - name: Install deps & run Playwright tests

        #  This `env` block is the most critical part of the entire test setup. Its purpose is to
        # securely provide all the necessary secret environment variables to the commands that
        # will be executed in the `run` step below.
        #
        # Without this, the application would fail to start because it wouldn't be able to connect
        # to the database or initialize the authentication system.
        #
        # SYNTAX BREAKDOWN: KEY: $`{{ secrets.VALUE }}`
        #
        # - `KEY:` (e.g., `DATABASE_URL:`): This is the name of the environment variable as the
        #   application expects to find it (e.g., via `process.env.DATABASE_URL`).
        #
        # - $`{{ ... }}`: This is the special syntax used in GitHub Actions to access context
        #   and expression information.
        #
        # - `secrets.VALUE`: This is how we access the encrypted secrets that are stored in the
        #   repository's settings. The `VALUE` part must exactly match the name we gave the
        #   secret in the GitHub UI.
        #
        # This entire block securely injects the values from the GitHub Secrets into the
        # virtual machine's environment just before the `run` commands are executed.
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
          NEXTAUTH_SECRET: ${{ secrets.NEXTAUTH_SECRET }}

        # The `run` keyword executes all the following lines as shell commands in sequence.
        # 1. `npm ci`: ("Clean Install") Installs the exact project dependencies from the `package-lock.json`
        #    file. This is the standard, reproducible way to install packages in a CI environment.
        # 2. `npx playwright install --with-deps`: Installs the browser binaries (Chromium, etc.) that
        #    Playwright needs, and the `--with-deps` flag also installs required OS-level dependencies
        #    for running browsers on a headless Linux server.
        # 3. `npm run dev &`: Starts the Next.js development server. The `&` at the end is crucial. It runs
        #    the server in the background so the script can continue to the next command.
        # 4. `sleep 5`: Pauses the script for 5 seconds. This gives the development server a moment
        #    to start up and become ready to accept connections before the tests begin.
        # 5. `npx playwright test`: The final command that executes the Playwright test runner. It will
        #    run all tests found in the `e2e` directory against the now-running application. If any
        #    test fails, this command will exit with an error, failing the entire workflow.
